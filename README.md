<br />
System Architecture<br />
The LearnHub ed-tech platform consists of three main components: the front end, the back end, and the database. The platform follows a client-server architecture, with the front end serving as the client and the back end and database serving as the server.<br />
Front-end<br />
The front end of the platform is built using ReactJS, which is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. ReactJS allows for the creation of dynamic and responsive user interfaces, which are critical for providing an engaging learning experience to the students. The front end communicates with the back end using RESTful API calls.<br />
Back-end<br />
The back end of the platform is built using NodeJS and ExpressJS, which are popular frameworks for building scalable and robust server-side applications. The back end provides APIs for the front end to consume, which include functionalities such as user authentication, course creation, and course consumption. The back end also handles the logic for processing and storing the course content and user data.<br />
Database<br />
The database for the platform is built using MongoDB, which is a NoSQL database that provides a flexible and scalable data storage solution. MongoDB allows for the storage of unstructured and semi-structured data, which is useful for storing course content such as videos, images, and PDFs. The database stores the course content, user data, and other relevant information related to the platform.<br />
<br />
<br />

Front-end<br />
The front end is part of the platform that the user interacts with. It's like the "face" of the platform that the user sees and interacts with. <br />
The front end of LearnHub has all the necessary pages that an ed-tech platform should have. Some of these pages are:<br />
For Students:<br />
Homepage: This page will have a brief introduction to the platform, as well as links to the course list and user details.<br />
Course List: This page will have a list of all the courses available on the platform, along with their descriptions and ratings.<br />
Wishlist: This page will display all the courses that a student has added to their wishlist.<br />
Cart Checkout: This page will allow the user to complete the course purchase.<br />
Course Content: This page will have the course content for a particular course, including videos, and other related material.<br />
User Details: This page will have details about the student's account, including their name, email, and other relevant information.<br />
User Edit Details: This page will allow the student to edit their account details.<br />
For Instructors:<br />
Dashboard: This page will have an overview of the instructor's courses, as well as the ratings and feedback for each course.<br />

To build the front end, we use frameworks and libraries such as ReactJS, which is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. We also use CSS and Tailwind, which are styling frameworks that help make the user interface look good and responsive. Additionally, we use some npm packages to add extra functionality to the front end. To manage the state of the application, we use Redux, which is a popular state management library for React. Finally, we use a development environment called VSCode, which is a popular code editor, to develop the front end.<br />
<br />
Back-end<br />
Description of the Back-end Architecture:<br />
LearnHub uses a monolithic architecture, with the backend built using Node.js and Express.js, and MongoDB as the primary database. Monolithic architecture refers to a design approach where all the modules of the application are combined into a single large program, with a single codebase, to enable better control, security, and performance.<br />
Node.js is a popular JavaScript runtime that allows us to run JavaScript code outside of the browser. Express.js is a web application framework that simplifies the process of building web applications in Node.js. MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database that allows for flexible data storage and retrieval, making it a suitable choice for complex applications like LearnHub.<br />
Features and Functionalities of the Back-end:<br />
The back end of LearnHub provides a range of features and functionalities, including:<br />
User authentication and authorization: Students and instructors can sign up and log in to the platform using their email addresses and password. The platform also supports OTP (One-Time Password) verification and forgot password functionality for added security.<br />
Course management: Instructors can create, read, update, and delete courses, as well as manage course content and media. Students can view and rate courses.<br />
Payment Integration: Students will purchase and enrol on courses by completing the checkout flow that is followed by Razorpay integration for payment handling.<br />
Cloud-based media management: LearnHub uses Cloudinary, a cloud-based media management service, to store and manage all media content, including images, videos, and documents.<br />
Markdown formatting: Course content in document format is stored in Markdown format, which allows for easier display and rendering on the front end.<br />
Frameworks, Libraries, and Tools used:<br />
The back end of LearnHub uses a range of frameworks, libraries, and tools to ensure its functionality and performance, including:<br />
Node.js: Node.js is used as the primary framework for the back end.<br />
MongoDB: MongoDB is used as the primary database, providing a flexible and scalable data storage solution.<br />
Express.js: Express.js is used as a web application framework, providing a range of features and tools for building web applications.<br />
JWT: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) are used for authentication and authorization, providing a secure and reliable way to manage user credentials.<br />
Bcrypt: Bcrypt is used for password hashing, adding an extra layer of security to user data.<br />
Mongoose: Mongoose is used as an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library, providing a way to interact with MongoDB using JavaScript.<br />
Data Models and Database Schema:<br />
The back end of LearnHub uses a range of data models and database schemas to manage data, including:<br />
Student schema: Includes fields such as name, email, password, and course details for each student.<br />
Instructor schema: Includes fields such as name, email, password, and course details for each instructor.<br />
Course schema: Includes fields such as course name, description, instructor details, and media content.<br />
Overall, the back-end of LearnHub is designed to provide a robust and scalable solution for an ed-tech platform, with a focus on security, reliability, and ease of use. By using the right frameworks, libraries, and tools, we can ensure that the platform functions smoothly and provides an optimal user experience for all its users.
<br />

API Design:<br />
The LearnHub platform's API is designed following the REST architectural style. The API is implemented using Node.js and Express.js. It uses JSON for data exchange and follows standard HTTP request methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.
<br />
Sample list of API endpoints and their functionalities:<br />
/api/auth/signup (POST) - Create a new user (student or instructor) account.<br />
